This software uses the WinRing0 low-level driver to read CPU clock speeds. Because this driver allows direct hardware access, Windows Defender and other Antivirus software will flag it as a "Vulnerable Driver" or "Malware."

This is expected behavior. The software is safe, but the driver is flagged because it is powerful.
